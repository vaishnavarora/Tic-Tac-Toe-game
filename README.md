# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
It is the most popular game amongst school students which they use to play in their free time or boring lectures. So we had tried it to make in such a way that a single player would be able to play the game if they have no one to play with them.

## how to run
1. Copy the code in any compiler.
2. Run the code.
3. A screen appears with Tic-Tac-Toe board on GUI.
4. Choose your Sign O or X.
5. Boom now you are ready to play with Computer.
